/**
 * These services provide operations for manipulating and querying Aircraft Sortie, Aircraft
 * Mission, Item Tracking, Flight Plan, Air Event, Sortie Prior Permission Required (PPR),
 * Diplomatic Clearance, Diplomatic Clearance Country, Airspace Control Order, Air Tasking Order,
 * Navigational Obstruction, Logistics Support, Track Route, Air Load Plan, and Aviation Risk
 * Management data. Aircraft Sortie information contains static and dynamic aircraft assignments,
 * departure and arrival times, and remarks. Aircraft Mission information contains static data for
 * mission planning to include assigned aircraft and crews, cargo pickup and dropoff locations,
 * unique identifiers, and prioritization. Item Tracking information contains data for tracking an
 * item from its origin to destination and how it may be configured during transport. Flight Plan
 * information contains schedule and route details. Air Event provides information concerning
 * various aerial events such as fuel transfer and air drops, as well as the associated aircraft
 * involved. Sortie PPR information contains details on operational access to a runway, taxiway, or
 * airport service. Diplomatic Clearance information contains details on the issuance and
 * coordination of aircraft clearance requests. Diplomatic Clearance Country provides information
 * such as entry/exit points, requirements, and points of contact for countries diplomatic
 * clearances are being created for. Airspace Control Order provides information concerning the
 * allocation, restriction, and deconfliction of airspace. Air Tasking Order information contains
 * details on the coordination of air missions and their tasks, resources, and timelines.
 * Navigational Obstruction provides the locations, characteristics, and boundaries of obstacles and
 * structures that can restrict or interfere with navigation. Logistics Support contains information
 * regarding the transport and maintenance of resources and equipment to sustain air operations.
 * Track Route information defines specific flight paths used by aircraft during the transport of
 * fuel and other resources. Air Load Plan information provides mission actuals concerning the
 * loading and air transport of cargo and passengers. Aviation Risk Management information help aid
 * in mission planning by accounting for factors such as mission complexity and crew fatigue.
