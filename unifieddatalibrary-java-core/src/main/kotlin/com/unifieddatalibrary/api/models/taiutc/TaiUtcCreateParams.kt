     * International Atomic Time (TAI) is a statistical atomic time scale based on a large number of
     * clocks operating at standards laboratories around the world that is maintained by the Bureau
     * International des Poids et Mesures; its unit interval is exactly one SI second at sea level.
     * The origin of TAI is such that UT1-TAI is approximately 0 (zero) on January 1, 1958. TAI is
     * not adjusted for leap seconds. Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is defined by the CCIR
     * Recommendation 460-4 (1986). It differs from TAI by the total number of leap seconds, so that
     * UT1-UTC stays smaller than 0.9s in absolute value. The decision to introduce a leap second in
     * UTC is the responsibility of the International Earth Rotation Service (IERS). According to
     * the CCIR Recommendation, first preference is given to the opportunities at the end of
     * December and June, and second preference to those at the end of March and September. Since
     * the system was introduced in 1972, only dates in June and December have been used. TAI is
     * expressed in terms of UTC by the relation TAI = UTC + dAT, where dAT is the total algebraic
     * sum of leap seconds. The first leap second was introduced on June 30, 1972. The historical
     * list of leap seconds can be found in this table.
